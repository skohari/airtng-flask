## About

Learn how to automate your workflow using Twilio's REST API and Twilio SMS. This example app is a vacation rental site, where the host can confirm a reservation via SMS.

## Set up

### Requirements

- [python](https://www.python.org/) **3.6**, **3.7** or **3.8** version

### Twilio Account Settings

This application should give you a ready-made starting point for writing your own application.
Before we begin, we need to collect all the config values we need to run the application:

| Config Value | Description |
| :----------  | :---------- |
| TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID and TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN | You could find them in your [Twilio Account Settings](https://www.twilio.com/console/account/settings)|
| TWILIO_NUMBER | You can get one [here](https://www.twilio.com/console/phone-numbers/incoming) |

### Local Development

1. Clone this repository and `cd` into it.

   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:TwilioDevEd/airtng-flask.git
   ```

2. Install the requirements.

   ```bash
   make install
   ```

3. Copy the sample configuration `.env.example` to `.env`, and then edit `.env` to match your configuration.

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

   See [Twilio Account Settings](#twilio-account-settings) to locate the necessary environment variables.

4. Start the development server. Before running the following command, make sure the virtual environment is activated.

   ```bash
   make serve
   ```

5. Check it out at [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)

6. To let our Twilio phone number use the callback endpoint we exposed, our development server will need to be publicly accessible. You could expose the application to the wider Internet using [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/). [Here](https://www.twilio.com/blog/2015/09/6-awesome-reasons-to-use-ngrok-when-testing-webhooks.html), there is an interesting article about why we recommend you to use ngrok.

   ```bash
   ngrok http 5000
   ```

   Keep in mind that our endpoint is:

   ```
   http://<your-ngrok-subdomain>.ngrok.io/confirm
   ```

7. You will need to configure Twilio to send requests to your application when SMS are received. You will need to provision at least one Twilio number with sms capabilities so the application's users can make property reservations. On [Twilio Account Settings](#twilio-account-settings) you could find the link to buy a Twilio number. Once you have a Twilio number you need to configure your number to work with your application. Open the number management page and open a number's configuration by clicking on it. Remember that the number where you change the SMS webhook must be the same one you set on the TWILIO_NUMBER setting.

That's it!

### Docker

If you have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) already installed on your machine, you can use our `docker-compose.yml` to setup your project.

1. Make sure you have the project cloned.
2. Setup the `.env` file as outlined in the [Local Development](#local-development) steps.
3. Run `docker-compose up`.
4. Follow the steps in [Local Development](#local-development) on how to expose your port to Twilio using a tool like [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) and configure the remaining parts of your application.

### Tests

You can run the tests locally through [coverage](http://coverage.readthedocs.org/):

```bash
coverage run manage.py test
```

You can then view the results with `coverage report` or build an HTML report with `coverage html`.

### Cloud deployment

Additionally to trying out this application locally, you can deploy it to a variety of host services. Here is a small selection of them.

Please be aware that some of these might charge you for the usage or might make the source code for this application visible to the public. When in doubt research the respective hosting service first.
